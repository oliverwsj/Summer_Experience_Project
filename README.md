# Summer_Exp_Project

The Summer Experience Project makes accessible the summer experiences of Colorado College students through filtration of a MySQL database.
As an intern at the Career Center, I began the project to make the data of the Career Center Summer Experience survey accessible and useful. The program was finished in my Software Design class, with a group of 3 other students. We used GitHub for version control and sharing of our code.

MySQL code is embedded within Java, and begins by creating a database from an Excel document with survey data. The database is displayed through a GUI created in Java. As the user interacts with the GUI, a filtration method sensitive to user selections shows the results of the query through a filtered ArrayList. 

The majority of the project was finalized in my Software Design class, sophomore year at Colorado College. The Strategy, Command, and Singleton design patterns were implemented.

The next step in the project is make the program available through the Career Center website.
